Some FiveM resources that could be used to create a RP server with minimal dependencies. All created by me with some JS, TS, Lua and React.

## Resources
Each resource has it's own README which contains details of what the resource does, examples of it in operation and possible improvements.

## Dependencies
- [PolyZone](https://github.com/mkafrin/PolyZone)
- [dpemotes](https://github.com/andristum/dpemotes)
- [Radial Menu](https://github.com/axln/radial-menu-js)
