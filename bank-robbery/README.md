# Bank Robbery

A very basic bank robbery system that allows you to purchase a hacking tool which you can use in the back of the Legion Square Fleeca Bank.

## Improvements

- Once a police system is added, hacking the bank could start a timer for a few minutes to allow police to arrive whilst the robber has to stay in the bank. Once this time has elapsed the money could become available.
- Receiving the money could be more interactive.
- There could be a more difficult way of receiving the hacking tool.
- Adding more bank locations.
