# Inventory

This resource manages a character's inventory, including weapons and ammunition. It allows for easy creation of shops to purchase items with cash and for items to be left behind in dumpsters.

## Improvements
- Dropping items on the floor.
- A way to access other users' inventory.
- Ammunition could be improved as it only allows reloading (adding ammo) when the gun is equipped - perhaps the gun could hold only a single clip with additional clips taken from the inventory when reloading (pressing R).
