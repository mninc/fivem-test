# Character Selector

This resource manages your characters and how they look. You can pick a character to spawn as, create a new one or delete an old one. It then lets you choose where to spawn.

Once spawned as a character you can update how your character looks with an almost identical menu to character creation. You can also create and delete outfits to change into at a later time.

## Improvements

- The clothing menu is based closely on what values are needed for the ped cutomization natives. The user interface could be improved - for example:
    - Using colour pickers and sliders
    - Reordering some inputs
    - Using names for each value instead of numbers (ie the name of the hat)
- Only allow users to enter the clothing menu at certain locations, and only edit certain values there - for example clothing stores and barber shops.
