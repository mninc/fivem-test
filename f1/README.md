# F1 Menu

Pressing F1 brings up a wheel menu with various options, some of which only show sometimes. 
Current only uses is for changing your character's walk style and some options for parking/retrieving a vehicle depending on if a garage is close.

I didn't make the menu design myself - that is [Radial Menu](https://github.com/axln/radial-menu-js). The walk animations are from [dpemotes](https://github.com/andristum/dpemotes).
